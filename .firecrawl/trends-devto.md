# 25 Web Design Trends to Watch in 2025

[#webdev](https://dev.to/t/webdev) [#design](https://dev.to/t/design) [#ux](https://dev.to/t/ux) [#ui](https://dev.to/t/ui)

Every year, I like to take stock of where web design is headed—and 2025 is shaping up to be one of the boldest years yet. This roundup covers **25 of the biggest web design trends** I'm seeing across the internet right now. Whether you're a fellow dev, a designer, or a founder figuring out what the hell to do with your homepage, this should help spark some ideas.

This originally appeared on [Spectrum IT Consulting](https://spectrumitconsulting.com/blog/25-for-25-top-web-design-trends-2025), where I share more resources and insights for growing businesses through thoughtful design and tech.

## 🚀 Interactive and Immersive Experiences

### 1\. Micro Animations

Tiny details with big impact. Micro animations help guide users, reinforce actions, and give interfaces that extra bit of polish. Think hover effects, button ripples, loading indicators—they're subtle, but powerful.

[![Peter Nottage's website showcases a ton of beautiful micro animations.](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fe8djosm0ydk4104bno2q.png)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fe8djosm0ydk4104bno2q.png)

### 2\. Cursor Animation

Custom cursors are in. Designers are using them as brand elements—everything from sparkly trails to responsive morphing shapes. It’s weirdly delightful.

[![The Observatory has a fantastic example of cursor animations](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F5bna5lpt3jme4l59yo3n.png)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F5bna5lpt3jme4l59yo3n.png)

### 3\. Scroll-Triggered Animations

Forget static content. Scroll-triggered animations add drama and structure to the experience—elements zoom, slide, or fade in as you scroll. It's like turning a page in a story.

### 4\. Experimental Navigation

Hamburgers and dropdowns? Snooze. 2025 is full of weird nav: radial menus, scrolling-as-navigation, and even gesture-based navigation on some sites. It’s not for every project, but damn does it stand out.

### 5\. Non-Traditional Scrolling

Sideways, diagonal, sticky-scroll, or scroll-jacking in a good way—creativity is bleeding into scroll mechanics, making them part of the storytelling experience.

* * *

## 🎨 Visual Design Elements

### 6\. Futuristic, Sci-Fi Gaming UI Aesthetics

Interfaces inspired by games and sci-fi films are on the rise—think neon glows, HUD-style overlays, and glitchy transitions.

[![Zero Gravity's website features an interesting futuristic and game like interface](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F56luvmfgroiylxz8aldf.png)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F56luvmfgroiylxz8aldf.png)

### 7\. Brutalist Design

Unapologetically harsh layouts, massive fonts, and clashing elements. Brutalism is still kicking, especially in indie and portfolio sites. Bonus points if you blend it with modern techniques like I did on my own site.

[![Spectrum IT Consulting features a neo-brutalist design, which combines elements of brutalism with other modern techiques](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fa6m4kqiazy4p77sqo7kj.png)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fa6m4kqiazy4p77sqo7kj.png)

### 8\. Organic Matter

Designs with earthy textures, wavy lines, and organic flow are balancing out the cold, minimal vibes of the past few years.

[![EveeRoseCo's website is full of earthy tones and flowing natural elements](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F04931whei9w4vl9t4473.png)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F04931whei9w4vl9t4473.png)

### 9\. UFOs (Unexpected Floating Objects)

Floating shapes, drifting blobs, and gravity-defying elements that dance on the screen. They break the grid in fun ways and keep things playful.

### 10\. Full-Screen Headers

The “above the fold” area is now “above everything.” Full-screen headers are visually intense and set the tone right away.

[![Nomadic Tribe's site features a beatiful full screen video hero](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F0w6xk50j25t33cazovwj.png)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F0w6xk50j25t33cazovwj.png)

### 11\. 3D Websites

WebGL and friends are being used for more than just cool portfolios—product showcases, interactive charts, and landing pages are all getting the 3D treatment.

[![Bruno Simon's portfolio features a really cool 3d design with game like navigation](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F6oi3gso4ski9qd0mkefo.png)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F6oi3gso4ski9qd0mkefo.png)

* * *

## 🧱 Layout and Structure

### 12\. Bento Grid / Bento UI

Inspired by Japanese bento boxes, this layout style uses modular blocks to organize content. Great for portfolios and dashboards.

[![Handkit features lovely bento elements](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F9fgpvmxi97yz0nejaco8.png)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F9fgpvmxi97yz0nejaco8.png)

### 13\. Grid Design (With a Twist)

Asymmetric grids are hot. Breaking the perfect grid rules adds personality while keeping layouts structured.

[![ETQ uses asymetric grid elements throughout their site](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fzlitc0qryxogx9y1akad.png)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fzlitc0qryxogx9y1akad.png)

### 14\. Negative Space / White Space

Whitespace isn't just trendy—it’s foundational. It makes everything breathe and helps direct attention to the stuff that matters.

[![Apple's website is full of negative space](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fn4ixahclkpysp57ioju9.png)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fn4ixahclkpysp57ioju9.png)

## 🔠 Typography and Color

### 15\. Expressive Typography

Type is no longer just functional. It's huge, it's moving, it's animated. Designers are using expressive fonts as centerpieces instead of just accents.

[![Expressive typography website](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fdypwcqo0b8kn3if8chr4.png)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fdypwcqo0b8kn3if8chr4.png)

### 16\. Color Trends

We’re seeing bold contrasts, saturated gradients, transparent overlays, and interactive themes that respond to user preferences. It's like a paint party for the web.

[![Thirsty Dumpling features a striking blue and yellow color palette](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fpcmum8dj8yr6xtmzrdgl.png)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fpcmum8dj8yr6xtmzrdgl.png)

### 17\. Dark Mode and Light Mode

It’s not just about flipping between black and white anymore. Great dark mode means rethinking design balance, color theory, and accessibility from the ground up.

[![Play features a very dark color scheme](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fhgwp2db8y01xai7yqtx6.png)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fhgwp2db8y01xai7yqtx6.png)

* * *

## 🧾 Content Presentation

### 18\. Text-Only Websites

Text-only layouts are coming back—especially for writers, devs, and minimalist blogs. Super fast, super readable, super raw.

[![People and Blogs features a very clean and minimal text only design](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fmefxzuo1ogw8ned5ufx6.png)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fmefxzuo1ogw8ned5ufx6.png)

### 19\. Custom Illustrations

Illustrations give a site instant personality. Bonus points if they're animated or interactive.

### 20\. Blending Images and Graphics

Mixing photography with graphical overlays—like doodles, arrows, and collage elements—is a killer way to add context and creativity.

* * *

## ⚙️ Technical Enhancements

### 21\. Chatbot Design

Bots have grown up. They’re now brand reps with personality, custom UIs, and seamless interactions. Think less "tech support" and more "concierge."

[![Domino's Dom is a chatbot that can help you order pizza](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fefezgnvqb5przigrcbk3.png)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fefezgnvqb5przigrcbk3.png)

### 22\. Smart Videos

Silent by default, looped seamlessly, and designed for performance—videos are now ambient design elements instead of content hogs.

[![The Cartier Agency site demonstrates smart video usage](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fj2chbdfgq7i971yfbsvm.png)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fj2chbdfgq7i971yfbsvm.png)

### 23\. Anti-Design

This is the punk rock of web design—clashing colors, chaotic layouts, ugly fonts, and attitude. It shouldn’t work, but sometimes it _really_ does.

### 24\. Increased Focus on UX/UI

The best UI is the one you don’t notice. Expect even more obsession with micro-interactions, user flow, and intuitive design.

### 25\. Responsive Web Design

This isn’t a trend—it’s a necessity. But the approach is getting smarter. Think foldables, ultrawides, and screen ratios that weren’t even on our radar 5 years ago.

* * *

## Final Thoughts

2025 web design is all about **personality**, **playfulness**, and **performance**. Trends are moving fast, and if you're not keeping up—you’re falling behind.

Great breakdown. Especially liked the point about scroll based storytelling. We’ve been experimenting with Scroll Snap recently and it really does shift how people interact with content. Also appreciate the mention of Green UX. It’s easy to overlook performance in favor of visuals, but optimization is becoming non negotiable. Curious to see how AI driven interfaces evolve past just chatbots. We think personalization at scale will be the next big push.

I see it's been a while since you’ve posted, but I just want to ask—has anyone seen a shift in client preferences lately towards more minimalist designs again? It feels like with all the flashy trends, some users are starting to miss simple, clean layouts. Would love to hear how that’s playing out for others this year. Anyone seeing the same in their projects?

## [Agent Factory Recap: Cracking Open an Open Model](https://dev.to/googleai/agent-factory-recap-cracking-open-an-open-model-42e6?bb=261117)

Welcome back to The Agent Factory! In this episode, we’re joined by Ravin Kumar, a Research Engineer at DeepMind, to tackle one of the biggest topics in AI right now: building and training open-source agentic models. We wanted to go beyond just using agents and understand what it takes to build the entire factory line—from gathering data and supervised fine-tuning to reinforcement learning and evaluations.

A portfolio 'Project Detail' template (Case Study) for a specific project.

**DESIGN SYSTEM (REQUIRED):**
# Design System: Pontus Corp
**Project ID:** 64427227226309016

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere
**Vibe:** Cinematic, High-Tech, Premium, "Alive".
The interface feels like a high-end sci-fi operating system or a luxury cinematic experience. It is deep, immersive, and fluid. The density is comfortable but structured, utilizing "Bento" grids to organize information. It balances high-tech minimalism with rich, organic motion.

## 2. Color Palette & Roles
*   **Void Black (#0a0a0a):** The primary background. Infinite depth. Used for the main canvas.
*   **Deep Slate (#121212):** Secondary background. Used for cards, bento boxes, and panels. distinct from the black void but still deep.
*   **Soft Charcoal (#1e1e1e):** Interactive states. Used for hover backgrounds and borders.
*   **Electric Aurora Blue (#3b82f6):** Primary accent. Used for primary actions, active states, and glowing effects.
*   **Neon Purple (#8b5cf6):** Secondary accent. Used for gradients and "magical" moments.
*   **Acid Green (#10b981):** Success and system status indicators.
*   **Pure White (#ffffff):** Primary text. High contrast for headings.
*   **Muted Steel (#a1a1aa):** Secondary text. Used for body copy and descriptions.

## 3. Typography Rules
*   **Family:** Inter (or similar premium sans-serif). Clean, geometric, legible.
*   **Headings:** Bold to Extra Bold. Cinematic scale. Tight tracking (-0.02em) for a modern feel.
*   **Body:** Regular weight. High readability.

## 4. Component Stylings
*   **Buttons:**
    *   **Primary:** Pill-shaped or soft rounded rectangles. Saturated gradient background (Blue/Purple). Glows on hover.
    *   **Secondary:** Ghost style with thin, glowing borders. Transparent background.
*   **Cards (Bento Boxes):**
    *   **Shape:** Generously rounded corners (xl / 24px).
    *   **Surface:** Deep Slate (#121212).
    *   **Border:** Ultra-thin (1px) border opacity (5-10% white).
    *   **Effect:** Subtle inner glow or spotlight effect on hover.
*   **Inputs:**
    *   **Style:** Minimalist. Deep background (#121212). Removing default borders in favor of bottom-border or subtle ring focus.

## 5. Layout Principles
*   **Bento Grid:** The core layout structure. Modular, distinct blocks of varying sizes (1x1, 2x1, 2x2) fitting together perfectly.
*   **Scrollytelling:** Vertical rhythm is driven by scroll. Elements reveal themselves, scale, or move parralax-style.
*   **Whitespace:** Spacious. Elements breathe. The "Void" is a feature, not empty space.

**Page Structure:**
1.  **Full-Bleed Hero:** Massive project cover image/video with overlay title and short description.
2.  **Project Stats:** A bento row showing: Role, Client, Year, Tech Stack.
3.  **The Challenge:** Text section describing the problem.
4.  **Gallery:** A grid of high-fidelity screenshots/renders of the work.
5.  **The Solution:** Text section describing the outcome.
6.  **Next Project:** A large card at the bottom to navigate to the next case study.
7.  **Footer:** Simple footer.
